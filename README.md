# portfolio_2
Second portfolio project for code institute.

In this second project I will create a rock paper scisors spock lizard game 
A game with 5 different tools at your disposal as you play vs the computer
This game of RNG and chance will test your luck, not your skill or kwnoledge 

Enjoy ! :D

This is the main look of the game on different screens

The main objective is to play a complicated version of rock paper scissors 
You have 5 options instead of 3
The rules of the game are shown on the popup image that you can hover 
As you can see, its a 1 defeats 2 and looses to the other 2 kinda game 
So you have about 40% chance to win, but probably less with my luck
